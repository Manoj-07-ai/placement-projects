          <h2>Black Panther</h2>
          <p>A "black panther" is not a distinct species of cat, but rather a term used to describe melanistic leopards and jaguars. Melanism is a condition where excess black pigment (melanin) is produced, resulting in a black coat. While their dark fur appears solid black, they still retain the typical spotted pattern, though it's often subtle and only visible under certain lighting conditions or upon close inspection. </p>
